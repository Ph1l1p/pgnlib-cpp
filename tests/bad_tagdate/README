The Date tag value field always uses a standard ten character format: "YYYY.MM.DD". The first four characters are digits that give the year, the next character is a period, the next two characters are digits that give the month, the next character is a period, and the final two characters are digits that give the day of the month. If the any of the digit fields are not known, then question marks are used in place of the digits.
