The Result field value is the result of the game. It is always exactly the same as the game termination marker that concludes the associated movetext. It is always one of four possible values: "1-0" (White wins), "0-1" (Black wins), "1/2-1/2" (drawn game), and "*" (game still in progress, game abandoned, or result otherwise unknown). Note that the digit zero is used in both of the first two cases; not the letter "O".
